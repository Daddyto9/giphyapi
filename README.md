Giphy API Homework

My first readme!

So, in this assignment my goal is to make a responsive giphy page that will automatically populate my divs with gif's from gpihy apis.

i am attempting this from absolute scratch, I have watched a few videos and have seen a few repos on the subject.
 
 but this will be my code. I will credit in the comments any code I borrow, but i dont think I will need to. but we'll see! haha!
